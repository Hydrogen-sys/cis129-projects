print('I am alive. I am old but growing, solid yet flexible and die when mistreated. I provide shade for creatures to rest and stay in the summer, and provide warmth for them in the winter. I am older than everything around me yet can die quicker than most. I am silent yet loud when with more of my kind. I am needed by most yet often mistreated, after all... I am a Tree.')
